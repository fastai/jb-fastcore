Exploring how nbdev may JupyterBook


## Notes

Things I like
- Don't have to move images
- Scrolling TOC on each page
- Built in search w/o ads with lunr.js
- The theme is really nice and modern
- There is very powerful markdown option that gives you almost everything you need. 
- Seems like there is 100% feature parity with things we have in nbdev (i.e. hiding cells, note blocks etc.)


Things I don't like
- Built on sphinx which is a much harder to understand documentation system compared to a static site generator.
